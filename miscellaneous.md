### What is artifactory?

  Refer to [here](https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/1898/what-is-an-artifactory)
  
  artifacts: the outcome of build process (stored in binary repository)
  Artifactory: a binary repository manager product and it manages store of artifacts
  
  Most of the times one would not use the binary repository directly but through a package manager that comes with the chosen technology. The binary repository can store individual application components that can later be assembled into a full product. It can make more efficient use of resources, reduce build times, better track binary debug databases etc.
  
  Some of the popular package managers that use binary repository:
    - maven
    - ivy
    - gradle
    - nuget
    - npm
    - pip
