1. The number of papers posted related to machine learning grows exponentially in the past years since 2009
2. In imagenet contest, methods using deep learning ahcives much better results than those without DL methods
3. Waymo: DL helps understand the environment around cars better
4. Improve grasp success rate of robot (from 65% to 96%)
5. DL in the area of self-supervised imitation learning (let robot imitate human being, RL involved)
6. DL in health informatics such as regular screening of disease
7. Novel scientific discoveries (e.g. predict gender, age through eye image)
8. Tensorflow: tool to express machine learning ideas. Computation is defined as graph
