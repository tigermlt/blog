  - recommemd content
  - recommend music (such as pandora music genome project)
  - recommend people (such as online dating system)
  - recommend search results (personalize search result rather than just information retrieval)
- Some terminology
  - top-N recommenders
    - for example, content-based recommender has individual interests store -> candidate generation module -> <- item similarities store
      - candidate generation -> candidate ranking module -> filtering module -> recommend results
      - item similarities store is where all the magic happens
