- Introduction
  - Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, high-performance distributed database
  - It is a column-oriented database
  - Its destribution design is based on Amazon's Dynamo and its data model on Google's Bigtable
  - The design goal of Cassandra is to handle big data workloads across multiple nodes iwthout any single point of failure
  - It is NoSQL database
    - store and retrieve data other than the tabular relations used in relational databases
    - schema-free
    - easy replication
    - eventually consistent
    - can handle huge amounts of data
  - Users can access Cassandra through its nodes using Cassandra Query Language (CQL)
- Data Model
  - every node has a replica
  - keyspace is the outermost container for data in Cassandra. It contains:
    - replication factor: determine the number of machines in the cluster that will receive copies of the same data
    - replica placement strategy
    - column families: represent the structure of your data
      - the schema is not fixed. Cassandra does not force individual rows to have all the columns
