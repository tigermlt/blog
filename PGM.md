- Overview and Motivation
  - some of the usage: image segmentation, predisposing factors of symptoms, textual information extraction, multi-sensor integration (such as traffic)
  - what is model: The model is a declarative representation of our understanding of the world. So it is a representation within the computer that captures our understanding of what these variables are and how they interact with each other.
  - probabilistic -> uncertainty
  - think of the world as a bunch of random variables and each capture some facet of the world. Goal is to capture the uncertainty of the world in terms of the probability distribution (joint distribution)
  - Graphical models such as Bayesian networks (directed graph), Markov networks (undirected graph)
