Events: A thing that can happen

Experiments: Have events as outcomes

- Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:
  - If outcomes can come from set A or B, then the total number of outcomes is:
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?|A&space;\cup&space;B|&space;=&space;|A|&space;&plus;&space;|B|&space;-&space;|A&space;\cap&space;B|" title="|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|" />

- Product rule of counting:
  - If outcomes are generated via a process with r steps, where step i has ni outcomes, then the total number of outcomes is: n1 * n2 * ... * nr
  
- combinatorics:
  - sort objects (permutation)
    - distinct: if n is the total number of elements to sort, then the total number of ways to sort is n!
    - semi-distinct: if there are n objects, n1 are the same (within the group), n2 are the same (with in the group) ...
    then there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{n!}{n_{1}!...n_{r}!}" title="\frac{n!}{n_{1}!...n_{r}!}" /> unique orderings (permutations)
  - choose k objects (combinations)
  - put objects into r buckets
