Events: A thing that can happen

Experiments: Have events as outcomes

- Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:
  - If outcomes can come from set A or B, then the total number of outcomes is:

- Product rule of counting:
  - If outcomes are generated via a process with r steps, where step i has ni outcomes, then the total number of outcomes is: n1 * n2 * ... * nr
